# How to run the program

Run the files in /code folder in order (indicated by the number at the start of file name)

_NOTE_: We are using API (= sending http request) to get the precursor sequence, so running _3_generate_precursor.py_ takes a while (15 mins). If it takes too long, just use the file 3_8_extended_precursor_seqs.csv by moving it to the /data/3_precursors folder.
